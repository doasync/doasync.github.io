Here's a summary of what was done according to the `PLAN.md`:

**Phase 1 (Foundation):**

1.  Installed the necessary dependencies.
2.  Created and configured the MUI theme (`src/theme.ts`).
3.  Set up the required Emotion cache provider and theme registry for Next.js App Router (`src/components/EmotionCache.tsx`, `src/components/ThemeRegistry.tsx`).
4.  Integrated the theme into the root layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`).
5.  Replaced the default page content with the basic chat UI structure using MUI components (`src/app/page.tsx`).

**Phase 2 (Core Chat Interface):**

1.  State Management: The `src/model/chat.ts` file now defines the `$messageText` store for the input field and the `$messages` store to hold the conversation. Events `messageTextChanged` and `messageSent` handle updates.
2.  Input Handling: The text field in `src/app/page.tsx` is now connected to `$messageText` and triggers `messageTextChanged` on changes. The Send button and Enter key trigger `messageSent`.
3.  Message Display: The chat window now renders messages from the `$messages` store, aligning user messages to the right and model messages to the left with basic styling.
4.  Auto-Scrolling: The chat window automatically scrolls to the bottom when new messages are added.
5.  **Basic API Interaction Foundation:** Sending a message now triggers an API request to OpenRouter, displaying a loading indicator and handling basic API responses to test the display flow. Replaced the initial mock response with actual API calls.

**Phase 3 (Settings):**

- Created `src/model/settings.ts` to manage API key, temperature, and system prompt using Effector, including loading from and saving to LocalStorage.
- Created `src/components/ChatSettingsDrawer.tsx` with MUI components for the settings UI.
- Created `src/model/ui.ts` to manage the drawer's open/close state.
- Integrated the drawer and its state management into `src/app/page.tsx`, triggering the initial settings load.

**Phase 4 (API Integration):**

- Modified `src/model/chat.ts` to replace the mock response with a `sendApiRequestFx` effect that calls the OpenRouter `/chat/completions` endpoint.
- Added stores and logic for handling API loading (`$isGenerating`), errors (`$apiError`), and token counting (`$currentChatTokens`).
- Fixed token accumulation logic in `chat.ts` to properly track total tokens per chat session.
- Connected token count display in `ChatSettingsDrawer.tsx` to `$currentChatTokens` store.
- Ensured token count resets to 0 when a new chat is created (logic in `history.ts`).
- Connected the API key, temperature, and system prompt from the settings model to the API request.
- Updated `src/app/page.tsx` to display loading indicators and API errors, and disable the send button during generation.

**Phase 5 (Model Selection):**

- Created `src/model/models.ts` to fetch the list of available models from OpenRouter (`/models`) and manage the selected model ID (`$selectedModelId`).
- Created the `src/components/ModelSelector.tsx` component with a searchable dropdown menu.
- Integrated the `ModelSelector` into the header of `src/app/page.tsx`.
- Triggered the model list fetch on application load in `src/app/page.tsx`.
- Updated `src/model/chat.ts` to use the `$selectedModelId` when making API calls.

**Phase 6 (History Persistence Foundation):**

1.  **`src/model/history.ts`:** Created this new file containing:
    - IndexedDB setup using the `idb` library for storing chat sessions (`ChatSession` interface defined).
    - Effector units (`$chatHistoryIndex`, `$currentChatSession`, `loadChatHistoryIndexFx`, `loadSpecificChatFx`, `saveChatFx`, `deleteChatFx`, `editChatTitleFx`, `chatSelected`, `newChatCreated`, `chatTitleEdited`, etc.) to manage history data.
    - Logic to load the history index on app start, load a specific chat when selected, save the current chat state (including manually edited titles), handle new chat creation (resetting state, including `$currentChatTokens`), delete chats, and edit chat titles.
2.  **`src/model/ui.ts`:** Added state (`$isHistoryDrawerOpen`) and events (`openHistoryDrawer`, `closeHistoryDrawer`, `toggleHistoryDrawer`) for managing the history drawer's visibility.
3.  **`src/components/ChatHistoryDrawer.tsx`:** Created the React component for the history drawer:
    - Uses MUI `Drawer`, `List`, `ListItemButton`, etc.
    - Displays the chat list from `$chatHistoryIndex`.
    - Allows selecting a chat (triggers `chatSelected`).
    - Allows deleting a chat (triggers `deleteChat`).
    - Includes a search bar to filter the history list by title.
    - Shows loading indicators (`$isLoadingHistory`).
4.  **`src/app/page.tsx`:** Integrated the history functionality:
    - Imported `ChatHistoryDrawer` and rendered it.
    - Triggered `appStarted` from the history model on component mount to load the initial history index.
    - Added a `HistoryIcon` button to the header that triggers `toggleHistoryDrawer`.
    - Connected the "New Chat" (`AddCommentIcon`) button to the `newChatCreated` event.
5.  Auto-Title Generation: is implemented and working.

**Phase 7 (Message Actions):**

1.  **`src/components/MessageItem.tsx`:**
    - Created the component to render individual messages.
    - Implemented hover effect to show action buttons.
    - Added action buttons (Edit, Delete, Retry, Copy Text, Copy Code) with icons.
    - Implemented inline editing using `InputBase` when "Edit" is clicked.
    - Added confirm/cancel buttons for editing.
    - Added loading indicator (`CircularProgress`) displayed during retry.
    - Implemented `navigator.clipboard.writeText` for Copy Text and Copy Code buttons.
    - Connected action buttons to corresponding Effector events.
2.  **`src/model/chat.ts`:**
    - Added `isEdited` and `originalContent` fields to `Message` interface.
    - Created events: `messageEditStarted`, `messageEditCancelled`, `messageEditConfirmed`, `messageRetry`.
    - Updated `$messages` store handler for `messageEditConfirmed` to update message content and flags.
    - Updated `$messages` store handler for `deleteMessage` to filter out the message.
    - Implemented retry logic:
      - Added `$retryingMessageId` store to track the message being retried.
      - Added `sample` block listening to `messageRetry` to prepare history and trigger `sendApiRequestFx`.
      - Added `sample` block listening to `sendApiRequestFx.doneData` to update `$messages` with the retry response, replacing the correct message.
    - Updated `sendApiRequestFx` to use the current message content (including edits) when sending API requests.
3.  **`src/model/history.ts`:**
    - Updated `saveChatFx` to persist `isEdited` and `originalContent` fields for messages in IndexedDB.
    - Verified that `saveChatFx` is triggered correctly after edit and delete operations via existing `sample` logic.
4.  **`src/app/page.tsx`:**
    - Replaced the previous message rendering logic with the new `MessageItem` component.
    - Removed unused `editMessage` import and related logic.
