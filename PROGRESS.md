Here's a summary of what was done according to the `PLAN.md`:

**Phase 1 (Foundation):**

1.  Installed the necessary dependencies.
2.  Created and configured the MUI theme (`src/theme.ts`).
3.  Set up the required Emotion cache provider and theme registry for Next.js App Router (`src/components/EmotionCache.tsx`, `src/components/ThemeRegistry.tsx`).
4.  Integrated the theme into the root layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`).
5.  Replaced the default page content with the basic chat UI structure using MUI components (`src/app/page.tsx`).

**Phase 2 (Core Chat Interface):**

1.  State Management: The `src/model/chat.ts` file now defines the `$messageText` store for the input field and the `$messages` store to hold the conversation. Events `messageTextChanged` and `messageSent` handle updates.
2.  Input Handling: The text field in `src/app/page.tsx` is now connected to `$messageText` and triggers `messageTextChanged` on changes. The Send button and Enter key trigger `messageSent`.
3.  Message Display: The chat window now renders messages from the `$messages` store, aligning user messages to the right and model messages to the left with basic styling.
4.  Auto-Scrolling: The chat window automatically scrolls to the bottom when new messages are added.
5.  **Basic API Interaction Foundation:** Sending a message now triggers an API request to OpenRouter, displaying a loading indicator and handling basic API responses to test the display flow. Replaced the initial mock response with actual API calls.

**Phase 3 (Settings):**

- Created `src/model/settings.ts` to manage API key, temperature, and system prompt using Effector, including loading from and saving to LocalStorage.
- Created `src/components/ChatSettingsDrawer.tsx` with MUI components for the settings UI.
- Created `src/model/ui.ts` to manage the drawer's open/close state.
- Integrated the drawer and its state management into `src/app/page.tsx`, triggering the initial settings load.

**Phase 4 (API Integration):**

- Modified `src/model/chat.ts` to replace the mock response with a `sendApiRequestFx` effect that calls the OpenRouter `/chat/completions` endpoint.
- Added stores and logic for handling API loading (`$isGenerating`), errors (`$apiError`), and token counting (`$currentChatTokens`).
- Fixed token accumulation logic in `chat.ts` to properly track total tokens per chat session.
- Connected token count display in `ChatSettingsDrawer.tsx` to `$currentChatTokens` store.
- Ensured token count resets to 0 when a new chat is created (logic in `history.ts`).
- Connected the API key, temperature, and system prompt from the settings model to the API request.
- Updated `src/app/page.tsx` to display loading indicators and API errors, and disable the send button during generation.

**Phase 5 (Model Selection):**

- Created `src/model/models.ts` to fetch the list of available models from OpenRouter (`/models`) and manage the selected model ID (`$selectedModelId`).
- Created the `src/components/ModelSelector.tsx` component with a searchable dropdown menu.
- Integrated the `ModelSelector` into the header of `src/app/page.tsx`.
- Triggered the model list fetch on application load in `src/app/page.tsx`.
- Updated `src/model/chat.ts` to use the `$selectedModelId` when making API calls.

**Phase 6 (History Persistence Foundation):**

1.  **`src/model/history.ts`:** Created this new file containing:
    - IndexedDB setup using the `idb` library for storing chat sessions (`ChatSession` interface defined).
    - Effector units (`$chatHistoryIndex`, `$currentChatSession`, `loadChatHistoryIndexFx`, `loadSpecificChatFx`, `saveChatFx`, `deleteChatFx`, `editChatTitleFx`, `chatSelected`, `newChatCreated`, `chatTitleEdited`, etc.) to manage history data.
    - Logic to load the history index on app start, load a specific chat when selected, save the current chat state (including manually edited titles), handle new chat creation (resetting state, including `$currentChatTokens`), delete chats, and edit chat titles.
2.  **`src/model/ui.ts`:** Added state (`$isHistoryDrawerOpen`) and events (`openHistoryDrawer`, `closeHistoryDrawer`, `toggleHistoryDrawer`) for managing the history drawer's visibility.
3.  **`src/components/ChatHistoryDrawer.tsx`:** Created the React component for the history drawer:
    - Uses MUI `Drawer`, `List`, `ListItemButton`, etc.
    - Displays the chat list from `$chatHistoryIndex`.
    - Allows selecting a chat (triggers `chatSelected`).
    - Allows deleting a chat (triggers `deleteChat`).
    - Includes a search bar to filter the history list by title.
    - Shows loading indicators (`$isLoadingHistory`).
4.  **`src/app/page.tsx`:** Integrated the history functionality:
    - Imported `ChatHistoryDrawer` and rendered it.
    - Triggered `appStarted` from the history model on component mount to load the initial history index.
    - Added a `HistoryIcon` button to the header that triggers `toggleHistoryDrawer`.
    - Connected the "New Chat" (`AddCommentIcon`) button to the `newChatCreated` event.
5.  Auto-Title Generation: is implemented and working.

**Phase 7 (Message Actions):**

1.  **`src/components/MessageItem.tsx`:**
    - Created the component to render individual messages using `Paper` and `Card` components for improved UI.
    - Implemented hover effect to show action buttons within a `Paper` component.
    - Added action buttons (Edit, Delete, Retry, Copy Text, Copy Code) with icons.
    - Implemented inline editing using `InputBase` when "Edit" is clicked.
    - Added confirm/cancel buttons for editing.
    - Implemented loading indicator (`CircularProgress`) displayed during retry, appearing on the relevant message (assistant or subsequent assistant for user retry).
    - Implemented `navigator.clipboard.writeText` for Copy Text and Copy Code buttons.
    - Connected action buttons to corresponding Effector events.
2.  **`src/model/chat.ts`:**
    - Refined Effector logic and state management to ensure accurate retry behavior and prevent race conditions.
    - Added `isEdited` and `originalContent` fields to `Message` interface.
    - Implemented `messageRetry` event and associated logic for retry functionality, ensuring correct message replacement/insertion.
    - Updated `$messages` store handler for `messageEditConfirmed` to update message content and flags.
    - Updated `$messages` store handler for `deleteMessage` to filter out the message.
    - Updated `sendApiRequestFx` to use the current message content (including edits) when sending API requests.
    - Added comprehensive `debug()` calls in all Effector model files (`chat.ts`, `history.ts`, `models.ts`, `settings.ts`, `ui.ts`) for enhanced debugging.
3.  **`src/model/history.ts`:**
    - Updated `saveChatFx` to persist `isEdited` and `originalContent` fields for messages in IndexedDB.
    - Verified that `saveChatFx` is triggered correctly after edit and delete operations via existing `sample` logic.
4.  **`src/app/page.tsx`:**
    - Replaced the previous message rendering logic with the new `MessageItem` component.
    - Removed unused import and references to the _old_ edit logic.
      The component now uses the `editMessage` event directly for confirmed edits.

**Phase 8 (Architecture Refactoring & Modularization):**

1.  **File Structure Improvements**
    - Created **feature folders** under `/src/features/`:
      - `/features/chat/`
      - `/features/chat-history/`
      - `/features/chat-settings/`
      - `/features/models-select/`
      - `/features/ui-state/`
    - Within **chat** and **chat-history**, split code into:
      - `model.ts` — _Effector unit definitions and wiring (events, effects, stores, samples)_
      - `types.ts` — _TypeScript interfaces, types, enums_
      - `lib.ts` — _Async effect handler functions, reusable pure functions, DB logic, API calls_
      - `index.ts` — _(optional) re-export barrel_
2.  **Effector Model Refactoring**
    a) **Types Extraction**
    - All interfaces (`ChatSession`, `Message`, `ChatHistoryIndex`, etc.), enums, and function parameter types were **moved into `types.ts`**.
    - This **decouples** type definitions from logic and allows **shared imports** without circular dependencies.
      b) **Effect Handlers Extraction**
    - All **async logic** (e.g., IndexedDB operations, API calls) was **moved into `lib.ts`**:
    - Effects in `model.ts` now reference these handlers via `createEffect({ handler })`.
      c) **Pure Functions Extraction**
    - Some large **pure transformation functions** used in `sample` blocks were **moved into `lib.ts`**:
      d) **Unified Chat Session Preparation**
3.  **Effector Model Organization**
    Both `chat-history/model.ts` and `chat/model.ts` now follow a **clear, consistent structure**:
    - **Imports:** Types, effect handlers, stores, utilities
    - **Events:** All `createEvent` calls grouped at the top
    - **Effects:** All `createEffect` calls grouped next
    - **Stores:** All `createStore` calls grouped, with initial values and options
    - **Store `.on` and `.reset`:** Simple store mutation calls
    - **Sample Blocks:** Grouped and commented by purpose:
    - **Debugging:** `debug()` call at bottom, watching all relevant units
    - **Additional watches:** For save events and failures, with console logs
4.  **Result**:
    - **Reduced file size** of `model.ts` files by moving ~50% of code to `lib.ts` and `types.ts`.
    - **Improved readability:** Clear grouping, comments, smaller functions.
    - **Simplified logic:** `sample` blocks now mostly compose pure functions and effect calls.
    - **Easier maintenance:** Isolated effect handlers and pure functions can be tested or modified independently.
    - **Foundation for future:** New features can be added modularly without bloating core model files.

**Phase 9 (Responsiveness Polish, Smoothness & Usability Enhancements):**

1. **Unified Mobile Drawer:**
   - Replaced separate Chat History and Settings drawers on small screens with a **single bottom drawer** featuring **tabs** for switching views.
   - Created `MobileUnifiedDrawer.tsx` with MUI Tabs inside the drawer.
   - Header icons now open the drawer and switch tabs instead of toggling separate drawers.
   - Smooth tab switching animations added.
2. **Removed Duplication & Refactored Drawers:**
   - Deleted `ChatHistoryDrawer.tsx` and `ChatSettingsDrawer.tsx`.
   - Introduced **single source** content components: `ChatHistoryContent.tsx` and `ChatSettingsContent.tsx`.
   - Wrapped these directly in `<Drawer>` inline in `page.tsx` for desktop.
   - Ensured consistent UI across mobile and desktop.
3. **Responsiveness Improvements:**
   - Adjusted drawer breakpoints to show unified drawer below 400px width.
   - Made drawer contents stretch full width on mobile.
   - Improved layout and sizing of inputs, buttons, and chat bubbles for all screen sizes.

   - Fixed search input so it no longer auto-selects on typing.
   - Added a **search icon** inside the model search field.
   - Made search input full width.
   - Improved dropdown styling and usability.
5. **Chat History List Polish:**
   - Truncated long chat titles with ellipsis to avoid overlap.
   - Improved title editing: now saves on Enter, persists changes.
   - Added consistent hover and selected styles.
6. **Message Editing Fixes:**
   - Fixed narrow textarea issue during message edit.
   - Message edit input now expands full width of the message bubble.
   - Confirm/cancel buttons styled clearly.
7. **Transitions & Feedback:**

   - Improved button hover, focus, disabled states.
   - Enhanced interactive feedback on message actions.
8. **Accessibility:**
   - Improved aria-labels and tooltips.
   - Ensured keyboard navigation works across drawers, tabs, menus.
   - Increased color contrast where needed.
9. **Code Cleanup:**
   - Removed obsolete components and imports.
   - Updated imports and props passing after refactor.
   - Modularized styles for maintainability.

**Phase 10 (Rich Content & Feature Enhancements):**

1.  **Message Content Rendering:**
    - Implemented rich content rendering in messages using `react-markdown`.
    - Added support for:
      - GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) via `remark-gfm` (tables, strikethrough, etc.).
      - Syntax highlighting for code blocks via `react-syntax-highlighter`.
      - LaTeX math rendering (inline and block) via `remark-math` and `rehype-katex`.
      - Mermaid diagram rendering via `@lightenna/react-mermaid-diagram`.
    - Created `src/components/MarkdownRenderer.tsx` to encapsulate rendering logic.
    - Integrated `MarkdownRenderer` into `src/components/MessageItem.tsx`.
2.  **Model Selection Improvements (Based on `SHOW_FREE_PLAN.md`):**
    - Added a "Show only free models" toggle switch in the Settings drawer (`ChatSettingsContent.tsx`).
    - Implemented filtering logic in `ModelSelector.tsx` based on the toggle state and model pricing data.
    - Updated the model display in the header (`ModelSelector.tsx`) to remove the provider prefix (e.g., showing "Llama 4 Scout" instead of "Meta: Llama 4 Scout").
    - Added `$showFreeOnly` store and persistence to LocalStorage in `src/features/chat-settings/model.ts`.
3.  **Model Info Display (Based on `INFO_TAB_PLAN.md`):**
    - Added an info icon button next to the model selector in `ModelSelector.tsx`.
    - Created `src/components/ModelInfoDrawer.tsx` (later renamed/refactored to `ModelInfoAlert`) to display detailed information about the selected model.
    - Implemented logic to open a right-side drawer (`ModelInfoDrawer`) on desktop when the info icon is clicked. (Later changed to Alert)
    - Integrated the model info display as a new tab within `MobileUnifiedDrawer.tsx` for mobile devices.
    - Added helper functions for date formatting and determining if a model is free.
4.  **Chat History Actions (Based on `DUP_PLAN.md`):**
    - Added a 3-dot menu (`MoreVertIcon`) to each item in the chat history list (`ChatHistoryContent.tsx`).
    - Implemented a MUI `<Menu>` with options: "Rename", "Duplicate", and "Delete".
    - Added `duplicateChatClicked` event and `duplicateChatFx` effect in `src/features/chat-history/model.ts` to handle chat duplication logic (cloning, saving, refreshing list, selecting new chat).
    - Connected the "Duplicate" menu item to trigger the duplication flow.
    - Reused existing logic for "Rename" and "Delete".

**Phase 11 (Fixes & UI Refinements):**

1.  **Layout & Core Functionality Fixes:**
    - Corrected persistent drawer layout behavior (`page.tsx`), including content shifting and conditional header button visibility.
    - Ensured proper message alignment and width constraints (`MessageItem.tsx`).
    - Moved "New Chat" button in header (`page.tsx`).
2.  **Message Editing Fixes:**
    - Ensured click-outside confirmation reliably updates UI (`MessageItem.tsx`).
    - Added double-click-to-edit functionality (`MessageItem.tsx`).
    - Ensured original content is restored on edit cancel (`MessageItem.tsx`).
3.  **Scroll Behavior Fixes:**
    - Modified scroll logic (`page.tsx`, `chat/model.ts`) to prevent auto-scroll on edit/retry actions and only scroll after a new user message is sent.
4.  **Message Interaction Refinements:**
    - Reverted click-to-outline behavior back to hover-based outline and action button visibility (`MessageItem.tsx`, `ui-state/model.ts`).
5.  **Retry Logic Fix:**
    - Corrected retry update calculation (`chat/model.ts`, `chat/lib.ts`) to ensure UI updates correctly, especially when retrying the last user message.
6.  **History Menu Update:**
    - Added "Regenerate Title" action to the 3-dot menu in `ChatHistoryContent.tsx` and removed the button from the header.
7.  **Settings UI Fix:**
    - Adjusted API Key tooltip placement in `ChatSettingsContent.tsx` to prevent overlap with the close button.
